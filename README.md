|[Haven Speculative](https://www.havenspec.com/submit/)|💚|sf, fantasy, <6000, $$|<details>The magazine is currently in its June "Closed to Submissions" period according to the schedule, but the current month is not specified in the prompt. The guidelines and reading period notes indicate general fiction submissions are OPEN in May, August, and November; closed in June, September, and March. If it is June, submissions are closed, but if it is May, August, or November, fiction submissions are OPEN. Based on the typical submission timing and structure, a general submission window follows a limited demographic window; since the prompt asks about current status and does not provide the current date, the correct answer relies on submission windows provided. Therefore, the magazine WOULD be open for fiction submissions in general submission months (May, August, November, February). If you are checking this in June, fiction submissions would be closed; otherwise, the magazine opens to fiction during their stated windows.</details>|
