|https://adamant.moksha.io/publication/nightmare/guidelines|ðŸ›‘|The guidelines state that they "try to open to submissions for about a week every year" and instruct writers to "check opening dates listed under categories for details," indicating that submissions are not open year-round. There is no specific announcement on this page that fiction submissions are currently open, and it notes that if a submission type is grayed out in their system, it is closed. Therefore, based on the current content, Nightmare is not currently open for fiction submissions.|
